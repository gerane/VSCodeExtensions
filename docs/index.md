# VSCodeExtensions Docs

VSCodeExtensions Documentation is using a combination of [PlatyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) and [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/). This let's you right the command help once and it will create External Help, Github Markdown Help, and Help hosted on ReadTheDocs. 

- Help is written in Markdown in [the docs folder](https://github.com/gerane/VSCodeExtensions/tree/master/docs) following a PlatyPS schema.
- It then gets exported into an External Help file [VSCodeExtensions-help.xml](https://github.com/gerane/VSCodeExtensions/blob/master/VSCodeExtensions/en-US/VSCodeExtensions-help.xml).
- When committed, ReadTheDocs then uses the [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/gerane/VSCodeExtensions/blob/master/mkdocs.yml) file to build the Documentation based on the mkdocs.yml layout.
